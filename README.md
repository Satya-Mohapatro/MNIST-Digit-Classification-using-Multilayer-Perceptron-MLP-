# MNIST-Digit-Classification-using-Multilayer-Perceptron-MLP-
A complete end-to-end deep learning project that classifies handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset using a Multilayer Perceptron (ANN). Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation (confusion matrix, saliency maps), and deployment with Flask + TFLite for edge devices.
